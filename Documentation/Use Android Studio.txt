This is a simple tutorial teaching you how to set up MT2D on Android Studio
-You'll probably face problens trying to compile it, but mostly the iuses are going to be 
-"easy" to solve (if you know NDK and Android studio)

REQUIRED:
SDL2 source: https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
SDL2_Image source: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
SDL2_Mixer source: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
MT2D source:

Clone android-project

on gradle->wrapper->gradle-wrapper.properties

-edit the distributionUrl to (or leave if the gradle version on it is higher than 4.1) distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-4.1-all.zip

go to File -> Project Structure.
1)on the App Module
2)Set Source and Target compatibility to the highest number.

Create symbolic links, open cmd as administrator.
1)go to your project folder
2)go to the app->jni folder.
2.2 for maki making a symbolic link you do the following command:
2.3 mklink /D *link name* *real folder*
2.4 example: mklink /D SDL2 C:\Libs\SDL2 
<!> DONT USE SPACES IN THE FOLDER NAME 
3)created a symbolic link named SDL (NOT SDL2!)
4)create a symbolic link called SDL2_MIXER
5)create a symbolic link called SDL2_IMAGE
6)create a symbolic link called MT2D

on app->jni->src->Android.mk add the below code between the #### below the SDL_PATH

####
SDL_MIXER_PATH := ../SDL2_mixer
SDL_IMAGE_PATH := ../SDL2_image
MT2D_PATH := ../MT2D
####

on the same file, edit the LOCAL_C_INCLUDES to

####
LOCAL_C_INCLUDES := $(LOCAL_PATH)/$(SDL_PATH)/include \
                        $(LOCAL_PATH)/$(SDL_MIXER_PATH) \
                        $(LOCAL_PATH)/$(SDL_IMAGE_PATH) \
                         $(LOCAL_PATH)/$(MT2D_PATH)
####

on the same file edit the LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES to
####
LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES := SDL2 SDL2_mixer SDL2_image MT2D
####

on app->jni->Application.mk, remobe the # from the APP_STL := stlport_static

for testing if everythign is working, make a simple main code like

#####
#include <SDL.h>
#include <MT2D/MT2D.h>
#include <MT2D/MT2D_Display.h>
#include <MT2D/Audio/MT2D_Audio_core.h>
#include <MT2D/MessageBox\MT2D_MessageBox.h>


#define APPNAME "Project-MT2D"

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    MT2D_Init();
    MT2D_Audio_Init();
 //   MT2D_Play_Music("menu.ogg");
    MT2D_Clear_Main_Window();
    MT2D_MessageBox("Yeah boy, its working on android!");
    return 0;
}
#####

NOTES:
-All files that are going to be used by your app must be inside the Assets folder.
-his folder must be created inside the main folder, ie.
-app->src->main
