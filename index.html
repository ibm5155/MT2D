<p>Welcome to the MT2D Engine Web page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">
<h4>What is MT2D</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Monochrome text 2D engine, is an FRAMEWORK where you can produce software<br />based on text user interface or even Graphics user interface, using a real terminal or an emulated one.<br /> As the name says, there's no color, and (in most of the cases) there're no size change, it's just the<br />basic 25x80 screen (there may be some platform specific console size where the<br />size is not going to be 25x80).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4 style="padding-left: 30px;">What operational system would it work?</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br /> WINDOWS (Graphics and Real Terminal support)</p>
<p>MS-DOS (Graphics and Real Terminal support)</p>
<p>LINUX (Graphics support [Real terminal support is quite slow and broken])</p>
<p>WINDOWS PHONE (Graphics support)</p>
<p>ANDROID (Graphics support [alpha stage])</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>What MT2D has to offer?</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Fragmented code: all the MT2D code is fragmented in a bunch of other source files, so you can just load what you'll need for your project, avoiding the use of having a bunch of uneeded code into your binary.</li>
<li>C and C++ compatibility (Tested with Borland C++, DJGPP, Visual Studio, Code Blocks, Dev-C++, Android Studio NDK and more).</li>
<li>Build in popups: a single line and you'll be able to create a messagebox and even an inputbox.</li>
<li>Keyboard, Touch (Basic interaction) and Joystick (in Alpha stage) Support.</li>
<li>PC Speaker support (and pc speaker emulation where it's not supported).</li>
<li>ObjectCore: A simple but powerfull code for making complex menus and games</li>
<li>Low RAM usage: depending of the operational system being used the engile will use less than 20KB of ram.</li>
<li>Engine Settings inside the source files itself, with a simple define you can change the way MT2D will work.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>What is that Graphics mode?</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Graphics mode is&nbsp; mode where you can render image files and also having an emulated 80x25 terminal, this mode has a limited support, for now it only works in MS-DOS and also platforms where it's supported by SDL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>What is that ObjectCore?</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ObjectCore is a simple way of making "Objects", those objects have a basic set of instructions, they have a screen coordinate, size, dynamic data types support and also an a set of states where you define step by step what this object should perform.</p>
<p>Each state can store a set of sprites (being in ASCII or images), a set of wait states and also Cscripts.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>WTF is a Dynamic Data Type?</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, it is a single var like int, but his data can be an integer, float, string, char, bool,pointer,...</p>
<p>This type of dynamic data is used to store information for the objects, like you could store a health data, race data,...</p>
<p>Or you could use it in your code without the ObjectCore part.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Cscript?</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Cscript is a simple but powerfull script support for C created by me :D, with that you can add for each frame of an object an action function, the action function is just like a normal c function, and this part is where you can take a huge advantage of it, if the build in Cscript functions in STDFunctions aren't what you need, you can simply create a new function in C or C++ and link it without any difficulty into your object states.</p>
<p>As an example, in Project Asteroid I had done a new Cscript function just for the menu so the option menu would call a single function where it would check the keyboard and also move the options or enter in the selected option. All that in a single Cscript function call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>
<h4>What are the good use cases where I could use MT2D?</h4>
</li>
<li>Making college software&nbsp; in C/C++ with a better presentation and the same difficulty to making the same software using just printf,scanf,getch,... (basically almost all my college softwares uses MT2D)</li>
<li>Making simple terminal games (like pong)</li>
<li>Makiing terminal applications where it could also support devices where terminals doesn't exist.</li>
<li>Making software for devices where low RAM usage matters.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li>
<h4>Are there any software examples of making use of MT2D?</h4>
