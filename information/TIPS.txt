-Do not include folders with '\' and yes with '/'.
because only ms-dos and windows will work with '\'
ex:
GOOD: #include "../../mt2d/Window_core.h"
BAD   : #include "..\..\mt2d\Window_core.h"
===============================================
Try to use the MT2D system functions instead of system only
ex: use Keyboard_touched instead of kbhit
ex: use Keyboard_Keytouched instead of getch
